Accurate estimation of interface normals plays a critical role in the numerical modeling of multiphase flows, particularly in interface tracking and reconstruction methods such as Volume of Fluid (VOF) and Piecewise Linear Interface Calculation (PLIC). Traditional gradient-based approaches often suffer from numerical inaccuracies when applied to discrete or binary representations of interface data. In this study, a deep learning framework is proposed to estimate normal vectors from binary volume fraction fields by leveraging transfer learning from synthetically generated continuous data.
The approach involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on local stencils of volume fraction data, where ground-truth normals are analytically derived from known geometries (e.g., circular interfaces) which is then utilized to train the neural network model using TensorFlow. 
This method demonstrates that deep learning can successfully generalize from smooth to discrete domains, enabling robust estimation of interface normals even in simplified or thresholded data formats. The results show promise for integrating machine-learned normals into CFD solvers to improve accuracy and efficiency, especially in industrial simulations involving complex multiphase flows.
